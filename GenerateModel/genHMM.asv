function model = genHMM(dataRecords, timeGranularity, expType)

%{
This function generates a model to be used for simulation porpuses later

Inputs:

- dataRecord: An m by 2 matrix where m is the number of time-granulated 
records for time series data and n is the number of attributes for each
record
- timeGranularity: The time granularity of the data record
- expType: Determines the model to be learned over the input data record

    If the expType is:
        - One(1): The model learned in this experiment type (expType)
        is a simple hidden Markod model (HMM) with 12 pre-defined states
        and the set of parameters learned via Maximum Likelihood Estimate (MLE)

    Discharge states:
        (1) Shutdown: When the discharge rate (9th column of the users data
        set) is 0 - This is a very naive assumption because in many times 
        the charge level is 0 but the battery charge level is higher than 
        0 and the phone has not been died out. In a more complex model if 
        the hidden variable is dependent on charge level we can assume that
        when the charge level is between 0 and 3,s say) the discharge rate 
        is 0 also, then the phone has been died out definately.
        (2) Idle: When the discharge rate is > 0 & <= 0.35/(10/granularity)
        (3) Low: When the discharge rate is > 0.35/(10/granularity) & <= 0.99/(10/granularity)
        (4) Med-Low: When the discharge rate is > 0.99/(10/granularity) & < 2/(10/granularity)
        (5) Med: When the discharge rate is >= 2/(10/granularity) & < 4/(10/granularity)
        (6) Med-High: When the discharge rate is >= 4/(10/granularity) & <= 6.5/(10/granularity)
        (7) High: When the discharge rate is > 6.5/(10/granularity) & <= 9.3/(10/granularity)
        (8) Intense When the discharge rate is > 9.3/(10/granularity)
    
    Recharge states:
        (9) Idle/Fully Charged: When the recharge rate is >-0.5/(10/granularity)
        (10) Early recharge state/getting fully charged: When the rescharge rate is <= -0.5/(10/granularity) & >= -3/(10/granularity)
        (11) About to get fully charged: When the recharge rate is < -3/(10/granularity) & >= -6.5/(10/granularity)
        (12) About to get fully charged: When the recharge rate is < -6.5/(10/granularity)
